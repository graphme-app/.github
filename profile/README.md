## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

GraphMe is a Slack app allowing to visualize metrics stored in Prometheus and Datadog directly from Slack.

**Reuse graphs in different contexts:** No more queries scattered in spreadsheets and docs. GraphMe is now the source of truth for your queries, and they can be parameterized for a better reusability.

**Customize the appearance of graphs:** GraphMe comes with a large number of options to customize how graphs look like. 

**Works with your time series database:** GraphMe does not replace your favorite time series database. Instead, it compliments it with a Slack integration allowing you to query for metrics right from your favorite collaboration tool.
