## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[GraphMe](https://graphme.app) is an application to query Grafana dashboards directly from Slack.

```
/graph me service-health:requests
```

**Query dashboards directly from Slack:**
Do you still take screenshots and upload them in Slack?
GraphMe automates this process without leaving Slack.

**Save and reuse common queries:**
Do you commonly share the same dashboards?
GraphMe allows to save common queries under an alias.

**Parameterize your queries:**
GraphMe allows you to use the full power of Grafana, but providing variables, a timezone, dimensions or a time range.
